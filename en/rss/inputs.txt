I have started working on a new application generating RSS-feeds from random web pages
https://customsolvers.com/en/pages/open_source/
I am already working on a new piece of software generating RSS feeds (i.e., properly-formatted XML files) via parsing the HTML code of random web pages with a compatible-with-this-format structure (e.g., social-media-like site where users post on a regular basis).<br/>I will be relying on Perl and releasing it as open source.

New QuickSearch adapters for various programming languages
https://customsolvers.com/en/pages/software/quick_search/adapters/
Although QuickSearch is still in a quite preliminary stage (not sure yet when version 1 will be ready), I have released additional adapters in various programming languages. My main motivation has been to help potential clients understand my flexibility on the programming language front.<br/>At the moment, the following languages are supported: C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript (Node.js), Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, VBA (Microsoft Excel) and VB.NET.

I start to actively look for clients/work
https://customsolvers.com/en/pages/attitude_2.0/expectations_2.0/
After having spent a relevant amount of time during the last quite a few months on having ready a descriptive enough public online presence (= my shop window), I have started to actively look for good clients/work.<br/>My expectations are very clear and I am willing to be as patient as required. So, I hope that will be able to find/be found by the kind of people and conditions which I want.

QuickSearch 0.5 released
https://customsolvers.com/quick_search/
Finally, I decided to release a preliminary beta version of QuickSearch with restricted functionalities. It is still quite far away from the proper verson I have in mind, but already gives a quite good idea about the main advantages of this approach: quick (searches/SELECT queries) and portable (no installation required).<br/>I will release v.1 as soon as I can, but without unnecessarily rushing things up.

https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1211504/UnitParser
I wrote an article about UnitParser in CodeProject. Although it is about the .NET/C# version, most of these ideas are also applicable to the Java version.

Iteration 4 of the varocarbas.com web domain ranking waiting for QuickSearch 1.0
https://varocarbas.com/domain_ranking/
As far as things are going reasonably well on the retrieval-information front, I will better wait for QuickSearch 1.0 to be ready before moving to the next iteration.<br/>Note that the transition between iterations is a quite aggressive process which takes relatively long time, which will be presumably reduced thanks to QuickSearch.
