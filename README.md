# RSS feed generator in customsolvers.com

This is an exact copy of the code being currently used at customsolvers.com to generate its RSS feeds, namely: https://customsolvers.com/en/rss/ and https://customsolvers.com/es/rss/.

Two issues to bear in mind:
- I haven't included any comment because it is a quite small, simple and clearly-named code. Also because it is meant to be an exact replica and the original version doesn't have comments :)
- I will not be updating the input files (https://github.com/varocarbas/customsolvers-com_rss/blob/master/en/rss/inputs.txt and https://github.com/varocarbas/customsolvers-com_rss/blob/master/es/rss/inputs.txt). They include the contents of the first uploaded version.
